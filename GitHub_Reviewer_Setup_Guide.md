### **Step 1: Update CODEOWNERS File**

Replace the placeholder usernames in `.github/CODEOWNERS` with actual GitHub usernames:

```bash
# Replace these with your actual GitHub usernames
@your-username â†’ @your-actual-username
@senior-developer â†’ @john-doe
@mid-level-developer â†’ @jane-smith
@architecture-team â†’ @arch-team
@devops-team â†’ @devops-team

   - `senior-developers` - Senior developers for service code
   - `mid-level-developers` - Mid-level developers for client code
   - `architecture-team` - Architecture team for shared libraries
   - `devops-team` - DevOps team for configuration files
   - `security-team` - Security team for security-related files

3. **Add Members to Teams**
