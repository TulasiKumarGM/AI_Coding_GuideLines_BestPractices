# GrpcDemos Project Overview

## Executive Summary

The GrpcDemos project is a comprehensive collection of C# sample applications designed to demonstrate various features and capabilities of the gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Calls) framework for .NET. This educational project serves as a practical guide for developers learning gRPC implementation patterns, showcasing both Microsoft's Grpc.Net and Google's Grpc.Core implementations across multiple scenarios and use cases.

## Project Architecture

### Solution Structure

The project is organized as a Visual Studio solution (`GrpcDemos.sln`) containing **10 distinct demo projects**, each demonstrating specific gRPC concepts and patterns:

1. **SimpleCalc** - Basic calculator service with synchronous operations
2. **AsyncEcho** - Asynchronous echo service demonstration
3. **AsyncChat** - Real-time chat application with bidirectional streaming
4. **MinimalHello** - Simplest possible gRPC client-server implementation
5. **MinimalGoogleGrpc** - Google Grpc.Core implementation example
6. **LifeTime** - Service lifetime management demonstrations
7. **ServerReflection** - gRPC server reflection capabilities
8. **Metadata** - Request/response metadata handling
9. **Deadline** - Timeout and deadline management
10. **GrpcWeb** - gRPC-Web implementation for browser compatibility

### Project Organization Pattern

Each demo project follows a consistent architectural pattern with **4 main components**:

#### 1. SharedLib (Shared Library)
- Contains Protocol Buffer (`.proto`) files defining service contracts
- Generates client and server stubs using `dotnet-grpc` tooling
- Defines message types and service interfaces
- Examples:
  - `SimpleCalc.SharedLib` - Calculator service contract
  - `AsyncChat.SharedLib` - Chat service with bidirectional streaming
  - `LifeTime.SharedLib` - Service lifetime demonstration contract

#### 2. ServiceLib (Service Library)
- Implements the actual business logic for gRPC services
- Inherits from generated base classes (e.g., `CalculatorServiceBase`)
- Contains service method implementations
- Handles request processing and response generation
- Examples:
  - `CalculatorService` - Mathematical operations implementation
  - `ChatService` - Real-time chat message handling
  - `EchoService` - Asynchronous echo functionality

#### 3. ServiceHost (Service Host)
- ASP.NET Core web application hosting the gRPC services
- Configures gRPC middleware and service registration
- Handles HTTP/2 protocol configuration
- Manages service lifetime and dependency injection
- Examples:
  - `SimpleCalc.ServiceHost` - Calculator service hosting
  - `AsyncChat.ServiceHost` - Chat service hosting with streaming

#### 4. Client (Client Application)
- Console applications demonstrating gRPC client usage
- Creates gRPC channels and service clients
- Implements client-side business logic
- Shows both synchronous and asynchronous calling patterns
- Examples:
  - `SimpleCalc.Client` - Calculator client with error handling
  - `AsyncChat.Client` - Interactive chat client with streaming

## Technical Implementation Details

### Protocol Buffer Definitions

The project extensively uses Protocol Buffers for service contract definition:

```protobuf
// SimpleCalc example
service CalculatorService {
    rpc Add (CalculatorRequest) returns (CalculatorReply) {}
    rpc Subtract (CalculatorRequest) returns (CalculatorReply) {}
    rpc Multiply (CalculatorRequest) returns (CalculatorReply) {}
    rpc Divide (CalculatorRequest) returns (CalculatorReply) {}
}

message CalculatorRequest {
    double n1 = 1;
    double n2 = 2;
}

message CalculatorReply {
    double result = 1;
}
```

### gRPC Communication Patterns

The project demonstrates all four gRPC communication patterns:

1. **Unary RPC** (SimpleCalc, MinimalHello)
   - Single request, single response
   - Synchronous and asynchronous variants
   - Error handling with `RpcException`

2. **Server Streaming** (AsyncEcho)
   - Single request, multiple responses
   - Real-time data streaming
   - `IAsyncStreamReader<T>` usage

3. **Client Streaming** (File upload scenarios)
   - Multiple requests, single response
   - Batch processing capabilities
   - `IAsyncStreamWriter<T>` usage

4. **Bidirectional Streaming** (AsyncChat)
   - Multiple requests, multiple responses
   - Real-time communication
   - `AsyncDuplexStreamingCall<TRequest, TResponse>` usage

### Service Lifetime Management

The LifeTime project demonstrates different service lifetime patterns:

- **Per-Call** (Default for Microsoft gRPC)
  - New service instance for each request
  - Stateless service implementation
  - Automatic cleanup after request completion

- **Singleton** (Custom configuration)
  - Single service instance for all requests
  - Stateful service implementation
  - Manual lifetime management

- **Google gRPC** (Grpc.Core)
  - Different lifetime behavior
  - Native library integration
  - Performance considerations

### Error Handling and Validation

The project showcases comprehensive error handling:

```csharp
public override Task<CalculatorReply> Subtract(CalculatorRequest request, ServerCallContext context)
{
    if (request.N2 == 0)
    {
        throw new RpcException(new Status(StatusCode.InvalidArgument, "Division by zero."));
    }
    return Task.FromResult(new CalculatorReply { Result = request.N1 - request.N2 });
}
```

### Real-time Communication (AsyncChat)

The AsyncChat project demonstrates advanced gRPC capabilities:

- **Bidirectional Streaming**: Real-time message exchange
- **Concurrent User Management**: Thread-safe user registration
- **Message Broadcasting**: Efficient message distribution
- **Connection Management**: User join/leave handling

```csharp
public class ChatHub
{
    private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, IServerStreamWriter<ChatMessage>> _joinedUsers;
    
    public Task HandleIncomingMessage(ChatMessage message, IServerStreamWriter<ChatMessage> responseStream)
    {
        JoinUser(message.User, responseStream);
        return DistributeMessage(message);
    }
}
```
